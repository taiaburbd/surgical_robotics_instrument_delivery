# Surgical_Robotics_Instrument_Delivery

## Project Overview
This project, titled "Computed Aided Surgery and Medical Robotics," focuses on developing a system, specifically the TS-60 arm, to deliver various surgical tools to the surgeon within the surgical room. The primary goal is to efficiently transfer a specific instrument from the tool plate to the desired surgical position, enhancing the precision and efficiency of surgical procedures.

## Key Features
- **Responsive System:** Responds to surgeon's commands for specific surgical tools.
- **Robotic Arm Movement:** Precise movement and positioning to select and deliver tools.
- **Precision Tool Handling:** Utilizes a suction mechanism for accurate tool pick-up and release.
- **Automated Workflow:** Streamlines the process from tool selection to delivery and return.

## Process Workflow
1. **Command Reception:** System receives surgeon's command for a specific tool.
2. **Tool Selection:** Robotic arm moves to the tool's location.
3. **Tool Pick-Up:** Suction mechanism engages to pick up the tool.
4. **Navigation:** Robot moves to the predetermined destination for the tool's use.
5. **Tool Release:** Robot delicately releases the tool for the surgeon's use.
6. **Return:** Post-delivery, the robot returns to its home position.
7. **User Interaction:** Surgeon can select the next instrument or conclude the program.
